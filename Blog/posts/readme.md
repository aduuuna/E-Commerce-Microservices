### Post services

**_ Path _**

a) `/posts` - POST Method - (Create a new post with a title and a body)

b) `/posts` - GET Method - (Retireve all psots)

**_ Storage _**

I will store this service in memeory instead of any database for now. So whenever I restart the servers, I lose all content stored

I have a posts object `posts = {}` which will store all my psots, so a `.get request` will retireve all posts being stored

Also a `.post request` will add a post to our posts object. But here is the catch, I will have to add an `id` to every post that will be created

id's will be generated by `randomBytes` from `crypto`.

**_ Add ons _**

Adding a `body-parser` this will make data sent in a form of json request get accepted
